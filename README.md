# SEM_ATTENUVERTER
Audio Attenuverter inspired by classic Tom Oberheim designs

My First experience with an attenuverter--turn a pot CCW, you get increasing amplitude and a signal in phase; CW and you get increasing amplitude with the signal 180 degrees out of phase, was the filter mod pots found an Oberheim SEM. Was I 14 years old? Well, it blew my young mind....Combined with the SEMs multimode filter you can get all sorts of cool sound with the attenuator/inverter + filter, but now, with attenuverters found everywhere, they are, well, everywhere.  This time I used the same core component that made the SEM attenuverter so cool, the somewhat unusual (but not unobtainium) center tapped pot as module's the centerpiece.  Homage to the mighty TO! At noon you get ground--zilch. Turn the pot and you get attenuverter action.  I also added bias offset for each signal, controllable by CV or a set 5V signal. This is an evolving design....it is for +/- 15V "large format" or Frac, a Euro redesign in is the works.
